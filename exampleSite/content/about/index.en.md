# Who Am I?

I am Pranav Chachara, currently a year 3 Computer Science student studying at Heriot Watt University Dubai.

I actively participate in the university's tech club of which I am the Ethical Hacking Director. I have a strong interest in cybersecurity & networking, other than that I am also quite fond of reading, playing the keyboard, origami and cats videos üê±



# Things I Do
### Python Projects

I make use of a wide array of Python APIs to create my own personal projects as well as lead projects in collaboration with others, more details on these can be found [here](/projects), links to their Github are also provided where possible.



### Bash Scripts

With extensive knowledge of Linux I write bash scripts to automate tasks and also create tools that assist me in PenTesting, some of these are [here](/projects), links to Github are provided where possible.

### Workshops

As the Ethical Hacking Director of the the university's tech club I organise several workshops providing insight into various cybersecurity related topics, also giving live demonstrations of hacks and usage of tools to not only members of the club but during classes for Computer Science freshmen.
