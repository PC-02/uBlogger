### Overview

This was organised by the university as part of the academic week, each school in the university was responsible for organising an event for the students within that respective school.

My school of MACS (Mathematical And Computer Science) had come up with the event of logic mafia, which involved a group of people trying to solve a puzzle, within that group 2 unknown members would try to sabotage the group. Here I was the puzzlemaster and had to come up with puzzles as well as oversee a group.
