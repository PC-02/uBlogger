### Overview

For my coursework in Artifical Intelligence I had to implement an A Star search algorithm in Java. I had to use this to find the shortest path from point A to G.

I also had to perform automated planning using PDDL, here I had to implement a virtual submarine, create locations and crew, assign it tasks and provide conditions for it to perform these tasks by itself.
