### Overview

Worked on a tool that may assist in PenTesting and also provides insight into the importance of webpage security. This program contains 2 tools, one written by me in Bash, this is used to brute force passwords on HTTP login pages. The other tool written in Python by a fellow student makes use of Zydra to brute force zip file passwords. The code for these can be found [here](https://github.com/HWTechClub/Password-Cracking).
